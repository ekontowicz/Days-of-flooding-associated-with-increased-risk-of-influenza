Measuring the association between flooding and influenza diagnoses for the Iowa population

In this study we used data from a large de-identified private insurance claims database and influenza PCR testing results from Iowa's State Hygenic lab to estimate influenza rates in the Iowa population. When controlling for known environmental and population level determinants of influenza transmission we evaluated the association between flooding events and influenza rates. The code supplied in this repisatory was used to aggregrate data to the three-digit Zip Code Tabulation Area spatial unit and yearly temporal units. Data from large de-identified private insurance claims database is only provided at the three-digit Zip Code Tabulation Area spatial unit and monthly to maintain confidentiality.
